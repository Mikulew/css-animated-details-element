## General info

The `<details>` tag is used for the content/information which is initially hidden but could be displayed if the user wishes to see it. This tag is used to create an interactive widget that the user can open or close. The content of the details tag is visible when open the set attributes.

Using these elements, I have created **a list of painters** who inspire and admire me.
